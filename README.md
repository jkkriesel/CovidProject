# CovidProject

Here is a link to the data that is being used for this project https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

I have split the data into two separate excel files, one being Covid Deaths and the other as Covid Vaccinations.  This was done to show joins in my queries.

I am using SQL to write queries and then using Tableau Public to show that data, but as I have Tableau Public I am unable to display my workbooks, so I will instead explain 
my process of using Tableau in a file posted on my respository along with the queries that were used.
