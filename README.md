# CovidProject

Here is a link to the data that is being used for this project https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

Then this is the link to my Tableau Public Project https://public.tableau.com/profile/jeff4315#!/vizhome/CovidDashboard_16213647753720/Dashboard1?publish=yes

I ended up creating 4 excel sheets with the queries that I used in TableauPublicQueries repository to create my dashboard.
